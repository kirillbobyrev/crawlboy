Idea taken from [Open AI Requests for Research page](https://openai.com/requests-for-research/#funnybot).

> Train a character-level language model on a corpus of jokes.
> To do so, build a jokes dataset (the larger the better; if you do so, please
submit a pull request and we'll link to your dataset), implement a 
character-level LSTM (or use an existing implementation), train it on this
dataset, and draw samples from it. If successful, the output from the LSTM
should be actually funny.
